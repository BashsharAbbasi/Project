    <h3 style="color: black" >Nature's Beauty</h3> <br>
    <p><b>
For most humans, the beauty of nature is represented by spectacular sunsets, magnificent vistas, colorful foliage and graceful wildlife. But her true beauty lies in her diversity and in both the interrelationship and interdependence of her physical forces, chemical processes, biologic systems and countless life forms.

Nature is both evolution and extinction, life and death, growth and decay. She is a mosaic of heat and cold, light and darkness, fragility and awesome power. Nature offers sunshine and hurricanes, swans and maggots, rain forests and pond scum, whales and bacteria, distant galaxies and the molecules of life.

Nature is neither good nor bad, benevolent nor judgemental, sentimental nor discriminatory. We enjoy her gifts and are subject to her whims. We are, after all, a component of her beauty, just like the golden eagle and the dung beetle.

<h3 style="color: black" >The Importance of Nature</h3> <br>

<p><b>The importance of Nature, ecosystem health and human-animal interaction are commonly
    undervalued, mostly likely due to lack of insight. However, given their interdependence, the
    preservation of Nature in its many forms needs to be prioritized in order to safeguard human and
    animal health and wellness.
    The health benefits of Nature for humans are
    gaining recognition in medical fields, with
    doctors prescribing “ecotherapy” (exposure
    to the outdoors in Nature) and pet therapy
    (time spent with companion animals) to
    combat a wide variety of ailments. Time
    outdoors has been shown to reduce blood
    pressure, heart rate, anxiety, depression, and
    other stress-related symptoms. Regarding pet
    ownership, the significant health benefits of
    the human-animal bond (for both pets and
    their owners) have been well documented.
    Human-animal interaction may alleviate
    stress, lessen pain and worry, provide company and give people a sense of purpose. Also, in
    some studies significant monetary savings have been linked to pet ownership being related to
    decreased doctor visits.
    Ecosystem Health (Eco-Health) also has a direct impact on human health. An ecosystem is a
    community in which producers (plants),
    consumers and decomposers work together in
    their environment (air, water and soil) for
    survival. It is necessary to distinguish between
    naturally-occurring ecosystems, and man-made
    ecosystems created through landscaping activities.
    While some landscaping may be appropriate for
    the development of residential and business
    locations, dramatic changes in land structure and
    use involving non-native plants, soils and grasses
    may prove detrimental to environmental and
    human health in the long-term.
    Wildlife and intact, naturally-occurring ecosystems perform beneficial functions – Ecosystem
    Services - that are essential for human survival. These are:
    1) Supporting Services - fundamental natural processes that allow the Earth to sustain life,
    namely soil creation, photosynthesis, nutrient cycling and water cycling. These processes make
    all other types of ecosystem services possible.
